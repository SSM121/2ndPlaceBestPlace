## Software Development Process
The development will be broken up into five phases.  Each phase will be a little like a Sprint in an Agile method and a little like an iteration in a Spiral process.  Specifically, each phase will be like a Sprint, in that work to be done will be organized into small tasks, placed into a “backlog”, and prioritized.   Then, using on time-box scheduling, the team will decide which tasks the phase (Sprint) will address.  The team will use a Scrum Board to keep track of tasks in the backlog, those that will be part of the current Sprint, those in progress, and those that are done.

Each phase will also be a little like an iteration in a Spiral process, in that each phase will include some risk analysis and that any development activity (requirements capture, analysis, design, implementation, etc.) can be done during any phase.  Early phases will focus on understanding (requirements capture and analysis) and subsequent phases will focus on design and implementation.  Each phase will include a retrospective.

| Phase | Iteration |
|-------|-----------|
|   1   | Requirements Capture |
|   2   | Analysis, Architectural, UI, and DB Design |
|   3   |  Implementation, and Unit Testing |
|   4   |  More Implementation and Testing  |

We will use Unified Modeling Language (UML) to document user goals, structural concepts, component interactions, and behaviors.

## [Communication policies, procedures, and tools](communicationPolicy.md)
## Risk Analysis
Lack of communication or procrasination on a task.
    - @mentions on Discord and assistance from other team members if they are stalled due to programming block.
    - Review stage of all projects before they are considered "Done"
    - Due dates set to give review time 
InterProgram incompatability
    - all hands Google search call to the team, until we find a solution.
